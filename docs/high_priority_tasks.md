# Science Data Kit High Priority Tasks

This document provides detailed implementation guidance for the high-priority tasks identified in the roadmap. These tasks are critical for the core functionality of the application and should be addressed first.

## 1. Map Functionality Debugging and Rebuilding

### Current Issues
The map functionality currently has issues when there is no Neo4j connection available. The code in `app/️map.py` needs to be refactored to handle connection errors gracefully and to separate entity recognition from taxonomy/ontology components.

### Implementation Steps

#### Debug Map Functionality with Error Handling
1. **Implement proper error messages when no Neo4j connection is found**
   - Add try/except blocks around database connection attempts in `map.py`
   - Create user-friendly error messages that guide users to the connection page
   - Add connection status verification at the beginning of map operations

2. **Add connection status verification**
   - Create a utility function to verify Neo4j connection status
   - Implement this check before any database operations
   - ✅ Add a visual indicator of connection status in the UI

3. **Create fallback behavior**
   - Implement a graceful degradation strategy when the database is unavailable
   - Add options to work with cached data when possible
   - Provide clear instructions for resolving connection issues

#### Differentiate and Rebuild Components for Entity Recognition
1. **Separate entity recognition logic**
   - Refactor `map.py` to separate entity recognition from visualization
   - Create dedicated modules for entity detection and processing
   - Implement clean interfaces between components

2. **Implement improved entity detection**
   - Review and enhance the current entity detection algorithms
   - Add support for more entity types and relationships
   - Implement configurable entity recognition rules

3. **Create reusable modules**
   - Design modular components that can be reused across the application
   - Implement proper dependency injection for better testability
   - Document the API for each module

#### Rebuild Taxonomy/Ontology Casting Components
1. **Refactor taxonomy management**
   - Separate taxonomy management from entity recognition
   - Create a dedicated taxonomy service
   - Implement proper data structures for taxonomy representation

2. **Implement cleaner interfaces**
   - Design clear interfaces for ontology mapping
   - Create separation between data models and visualization
   - Implement proper validation for taxonomy operations

3. **Create visualization tools**
   - Enhance the visualization of taxonomies and ontologies
   - Add interactive elements for taxonomy exploration
   - Implement filtering and search capabilities

4. **Add support for importing existing taxonomies**
   - Implement import functionality for standard taxonomy formats
   - Create validation for imported taxonomies
   - Add mapping tools to align imported taxonomies with existing data

## 2. Neo4j Database Save and Load Feature

### Current Issues
The application currently lacks functionality to save and load Neo4j databases, especially in the Docker implementation. This feature is needed to make the database more portable and to enable backup/restore capabilities.

### Implementation Steps

#### Implement Database Export Functionality
1. **Create NetworkX graph conversion** ✅
   - ✅ Implement a function to convert Neo4j graph to NetworkX format
   - ✅ Ensure all node properties and relationships are preserved
   - ✅ Add support for handling large graphs efficiently

2. **Develop custom export solution** ✅
   - ✅ Create a custom export solution that works with the Docker implementation
   - ✅ Implement a streaming approach for large databases
   - [ ] Add options for selective export of specific subgraphs

3. **Add progress indicators** ✅
   - ✅ Implement progress tracking for export operations
   - [ ] Add cancellation capability for long-running exports
   - ✅ Create detailed logs of export operations

#### Implement Database Import Functionality
1. **Create import validation** ✅
   - ✅ Implement validation checks before importing data
   - ✅ Add schema compatibility verification
   - ✅ Create data integrity checks

2. **Develop merge strategies** ✅
   - ✅ Implement options for merging imported data with existing database
   - ✅ Add conflict resolution strategies
   - [ ] Create options for updating vs. replacing existing data

3. **Add transaction support** ✅
   - ✅ Implement transactional imports to prevent partial updates
   - ✅ Add rollback capability for failed imports
   - ✅ Create detailed logs of import operations

#### Add Database Version Management
1. **Implement versioning system**
   - [ ] Create a database versioning scheme
   - [ ] Add version metadata to exports
   - [ ] Implement version compatibility checks

2. **Create migration tools**
   - [ ] Develop tools to migrate between database versions
   - [ ] Implement schema evolution capabilities
   - [ ] Add data transformation options for version compatibility

3. **Add backup creation**
   - ✅ Implement automatic backups before major operations
   - [ ] Create a backup rotation strategy
   - [ ] Add options for backup compression and encryption

## 3. Operationalize Chat Page with Neo4j Graph RAG

### Current Status
The chat functionality in `app/chat.py` is now working in a basic way for OpenAI. It serves as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) demonstrating that the application can communicate with an LLM. The GraphRAG code has been uncommented and implemented with proper error handling, and the conversation interface has been improved for better readability.

### Completed Steps
- ✅ Uncommented and fixed GraphRAG functionality
- ✅ Added proper error handling for GraphRAG queries
- ✅ Implemented connection pooling for efficient database access
- ✅ Created authentication form for LLM API credentials
- ✅ Implemented multiple LLM provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- ✅ Enhanced chat interface with improved formatting
- ✅ Added conversation history management
