# Science Data Kit High Priority Tasks

This document provides detailed implementation guidance for the high-priority tasks identified in the roadmap. These tasks are critical for the core functionality of the application and should be addressed first.

## 1. Map Functionality Debugging and Rebuilding

### Current Issues
The map functionality currently has issues when there is no Neo4j connection available. The code in `app/Ô∏èmap.py` needs to be refactored to handle connection errors gracefully and to separate entity recognition from taxonomy/ontology components.

### Implementation Steps

#### Debug Map Functionality with Error Handling
1. **Implement proper error messages when no Neo4j connection is found**
   - Add try/except blocks around database connection attempts in `map.py`
   - Create user-friendly error messages that guide users to the connection page
   - Add connection status verification at the beginning of map operations

2. **Add connection status verification**
   - Create a utility function to verify Neo4j connection status
   - Implement this check before any database operations
   - Add a visual indicator of connection status in the UI

3. **Create fallback behavior**
   - Implement a graceful degradation strategy when the database is unavailable
   - Add options to work with cached data when possible
   - Provide clear instructions for resolving connection issues

#### Differentiate and Rebuild Components for Entity Recognition
1. **Separate entity recognition logic**
   - Refactor `map.py` to separate entity recognition from visualization
   - Create dedicated modules for entity detection and processing
   - Implement clean interfaces between components

2. **Implement improved entity detection**
   - Review and enhance the current entity detection algorithms
   - Add support for more entity types and relationships
   - Implement configurable entity recognition rules

3. **Create reusable modules**
   - Design modular components that can be reused across the application
   - Implement proper dependency injection for better testability
   - Document the API for each module

#### Rebuild Taxonomy/Ontology Casting Components
1. **Refactor taxonomy management**
   - Separate taxonomy management from entity recognition
   - Create a dedicated taxonomy service
   - Implement proper data structures for taxonomy representation

2. **Implement cleaner interfaces**
   - Design clear interfaces for ontology mapping
   - Create separation between data models and visualization
   - Implement proper validation for taxonomy operations

3. **Create visualization tools**
   - Enhance the visualization of taxonomies and ontologies
   - Add interactive elements for taxonomy exploration
   - Implement filtering and search capabilities

## 2. Neo4j Database Save and Load Feature

### Current Issues
The application currently lacks functionality to save and load Neo4j databases, especially in the Docker implementation. This feature is needed to make the database more portable and to enable backup/restore capabilities.

### Implementation Steps

#### Implement Database Export Functionality
1. **Create NetworkX graph conversion**
   - Implement a function to convert Neo4j graph to NetworkX format
   - Ensure all node properties and relationships are preserved
   - Add support for handling large graphs efficiently

2. **Develop custom export solution**
   - Create a custom export solution that works with the Docker implementation
   - Implement a streaming approach for large databases
   - Add options for selective export of specific subgraphs

3. **Add progress indicators**
   - Implement progress tracking for export operations
   - Add cancellation capability for long-running exports
   - Create detailed logs of export operations

#### Implement Database Import Functionality
1. **Create import validation**
   - Implement validation checks before importing data
   - Add schema compatibility verification
   - Create data integrity checks

2. **Develop merge strategies**
   - Implement options for merging imported data with existing database
   - Add conflict resolution strategies
   - Create options for updating vs. replacing existing data

3. **Add transaction support**
   - Implement transactional imports to prevent partial updates
   - Add rollback capability for failed imports
   - Create detailed logs of import operations

#### Add Database Version Management
1. **Implement versioning system**
   - Create a database versioning scheme
   - Add version metadata to exports
   - Implement version compatibility checks

2. **Create migration tools**
   - Develop tools to migrate between database versions
   - Implement schema evolution capabilities
   - Add data transformation options for version compatibility

3. **Add backup creation**
   - Implement automatic backups before major operations
   - Create a backup rotation strategy
   - Add options for backup compression and encryption

## 3. Operationalize Chat Page with Neo4j Graph RAG

### Current Issues
The chat functionality in `app/chat.py` has GraphRAG code that is currently commented out. The page needs to be operationalized with proper Neo4j graph RAG library integration and form inputs for different LLM connections.

### Implementation Steps

#### Implement Neo4j Graph RAG Library Integration
1. **Uncomment and fix GraphRAG functionality**
   - Uncomment the GraphRAG imports and implementation in `chat.py`
   - Update the code to work with the latest version of the library
   - Implement proper initialization and configuration

2. **Add proper error handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for GraphRAG queries
   - Add fallback options when queries fail
   - Create user-friendly error messages

3. **Implement connection pooling**
   - Add connection pooling for efficient database access
   - Implement proper resource management
   - Add monitoring for connection health

#### Add Form Input for Different LLM Connections
1. **Create authentication form**
   - Design and implement a form for LLM API credentials
   - Add validation for API keys and endpoints
   - Implement secure storage of credentials

2. **Implement multiple provider support**
   - Add support for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Create provider-specific configuration options
   - Implement adapter pattern for provider interchangeability

3. **Add credential validation**
   - Implement real-time validation of API credentials
   - Add secure storage using environment variables or a secrets manager
   - Create a credential rotation strategy

#### Enhance Chat Interface
1. **Improve response formatting**
   - Enhance the display of chat responses
   - Add support for markdown, code blocks, and other formatting
   - Implement syntax highlighting for code responses

2. **Add conversation history management**
   - Create a system for managing conversation history
   - Implement options for saving and loading conversations
   - Add context window management for long conversations

3. **Implement context-aware responses**
   - Enhance responses with graph context
   - Add visual elements showing relevant graph nodes
   - Implement interactive exploration of related concepts
