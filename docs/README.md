# Science Data Kit - Documentation

This directory contains documentation files for the Science Data Kit project, including development roadmaps, task lists, and implementation guides.

## Documentation Files

### [tasks.md](tasks.md)

A comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Science Data Kit project. Tasks are organized by category and include both architectural and code-level improvements.

**Categories:**
- Architecture Improvements
- Code Quality Improvements
- Feature Improvements
- Performance Improvements
- Documentation Improvements
- Deployment Improvements

Each task has a checkbox that can be checked off when completed, making it easy to track progress.

### [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)

A strategic view of the project's development, organized by priority level. Tasks are categorized as High, Medium, or Low priority to guide development efforts.

**Priority Levels:**
- **High Priority** - Critical for core functionality
- **Medium Priority** - Important for improving the application
- **Low Priority** - Would enhance the application but can be addressed later

This file helps guide prioritization efforts and provides a clear path forward for the project.

### [high_priority_tasks.md](high_priority_tasks.md)

Detailed implementation guidance for the high-priority tasks identified in the roadmap. For each task, this file provides:
- A description of the current issues or status
- Detailed implementation steps with specific code-level guidance
- Checkmarks for completed subtasks

This file is particularly useful for developers working on the highest-priority tasks, as it provides concrete guidance on what needs to be done and how to do it.

## How These Documents Work Together

These documentation files are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive view of the project's development:

1. **tasks.md** provides a complete inventory of all tasks that need to be addressed.
2. **roadmap.md** organizes these tasks by priority to guide development efforts.
3. **high_priority_tasks.md** provides detailed implementation guidance for the highest-priority tasks.

## Using These Documents

- **Project Managers** can use roadmap.md to plan development sprints and allocate resources.
- **Developers** can use high_priority_tasks.md for detailed implementation guidance on current priorities.
- **Contributors** can use tasks.md to find areas where they can help improve the project.

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to these documentation files, please follow these guidelines:

1. **tasks.md**: Add new tasks with clear, actionable descriptions. Mark completed tasks with a checkmark [âœ“].
2. **roadmap.md**: Update priority levels as needed based on project requirements and progress.
3. **high_priority_tasks.md**: Add detailed implementation guidance for high-priority tasks, including specific code-level instructions.
