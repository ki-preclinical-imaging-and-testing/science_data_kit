   - [ ] Implement a configuration validation system

[ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
   - [ ] Create a centralized error handling system
   - [ ] Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
   - [ ] Implement user-friendly error messages and recovery options

### 5. Code Quality Improvements

[ ] Fix code duplication
   - [ ] Refactor duplicated code in map.py (contains code from multiple files)
   - [ ] Create reusable components for common UI elements
   - [✓] Implement consistent status indicators across components
   - [ ] Extract common database operations into utility functions

[ ] Enhance type safety
   - [ ] Add type hints to function parameters and return values
   - [ ] Implement input validation for user inputs
   - [ ] Add assertions and contracts for critical functions

[ ] Implement testing
   - [ ] Create unit tests for utility functions
   - [ ] Implement integration tests for database operations
   - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

### 6. Performance Improvements

[ ] Optimize database queries
   - [ ] Review and optimize Cypher queries for better performance
   - [ ] Implement query caching for frequently used queries
   - [ ] Add database indexes for commonly queried properties

[ ] Enhance large dataset handling
   - [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
   - [ ] Add streaming support for large file operations
   - [ ] Optimize memory usage for large data processing
