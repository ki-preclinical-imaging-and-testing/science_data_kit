## Conclusion

The Science Data Kit project has successfully achieved its goal of becoming a comprehensive tool for scientific data analysis and visualization. Through the systematic implementation of nine major roadmaps across three development phases, the SDK has evolved into a robust platform with extensive capabilities.

With the first three phases completed and archived, the project is now entering Phase 4, which focuses on enhancing maintainability, performance, and user experience. Many tasks from previous phases have been collected in the [roadmap_later.md](roadmap_later.md) file and prioritized for implementation in Phase 4. The project continues to be maintained and enhanced based on user feedback and emerging requirements.
