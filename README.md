# Science Data Kit ("SDK")

Scan your messy science data, remap, visualize, and enrich using built-in knowledge graph capabilities.

## Simplifying FAIR+ data in your lab

### What is this?
**Science Data Toolkit** helps you index, curate, and integrate multimodal research data.

## FAIR+ Data
The FAIR(+) Data Principles have been established (and appended). 

Let's follow them. We can have *nice things*.

Science data that is...

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**eusable
- **+** (Computable)

... is *nice things* science data. Let's have it!
## Getting started

Ensure all requirements are installed. Then you can run 

    streamlit run start.py

from the repository base. Once this is running, you can access from your
browser window by navigating to 

    localhost:8501

or whichever port `streamlit` automatically maps your applcation to (see output
of streamlit)
