# Database Configuration Guide

## Overview
This document explains how to configure the database connection for the Science Data Kit application.

## Configuration Files
The application uses YAML configuration files to store database connection details. There are three configuration files, listed in order of priority:

1. `app/.db_config_auto.yaml` - Automatically generated by the application when a Neo4j container is started
2. `.db_config.yaml` - User-defined hidden configuration file
3. `db_config.yaml` - User-defined visible configuration file

If multiple configuration files exist, the application will use the first one it finds in the order listed above.

## Configuration File Structure
Each configuration file should have the following structure:

```yaml
uri: "bolt://hostname:port"
user: "username"
password: "password"
database: "database_name"
```

Where:
- `uri` is the Neo4j connection URI (e.g., "bolt://localhost:7687")
- `user` is the Neo4j username (default: "neo4j")
- `password` is the Neo4j password
- `database` is the Neo4j database name (default: "neo4j")

## How to Configure
1. Create or edit one of the configuration files (preferably `db_config.yaml`)
2. Set the appropriate values for your Neo4j instance
3. Restart the application to apply the changes

## Automatic Configuration
When you start a Neo4j container through the application, it will automatically create or update the `app/.db_config_auto.yaml` file with the connection details for the container. This ensures that the application can connect to the Neo4j instance even if the container's IP address changes.

## Security Considerations
- The configuration files contain sensitive information (passwords)
- Ensure that the configuration files are not committed to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude these files
- Consider using different passwords for development and production environments
